			 As a senior developer on the Procurement Team at Coupa, I led development of features,

			 At Coupa, a lead developer on a feature is responsible for architecture, design and execution of the software.
			 My primary responsibility when leading feature development was to be personally responsible for keeping 
			 alignment between the design document, story "acceptance criteria" and test coverage. 
		</p>
		<p class="mt-3">
			The Coupa "Enterprise" application is one of the world's largest Rails applications,
			maintained by thousands of engineers making regular commits through a proprietary CI pipeline. 
			The CI pipeline runs the automated test suite and performs other validations
			using Jenkins and GitHub PR hooks. Pull requests can only be merged if all checks pass (no exceptions!)
			In my time at Coupa, I authored several hundred pull requests and peer reviewed at least as many.
			The application stack is mostly Ruby on Rails code, with some React components to provide 
			a more responsive experience for the user. Data persistence is handled with MySQL.
		</p>
		<p>
			Coupa software is used by thousands of employees every day, world-wide. At this scale,
			every change in the software requires commitment to following best practices without exception. 
			Diligent, meticulous and redudant peer reviews, comprehensive automated test coverage and close collaboration
			between Product Managers, Developers and Test Engineers assure the production code is secure, reliable and performant.

		<h2>Passion Projects</h2>

		<h3 class="mt-5 fs-5 lh-lg">Random Chapters of the Tao Te Ching</h3>
		<p>
			For this project, I used React and Material UI. It's built and deployed as a static app.</p>
		<p>
			I've carried a copy of The Tao Te Ching in my backpack for several decades. The book
			was a gift from my step-father, received when I was a young adult. On breaks from work, I  
			turn to a random page and read the chapter that presents itself. I like to use the content of the Tao
			when I experiment with new technology.

		<p>
			In 2013, I facilitated a workshop for elementary school students. Enrollment was open to any student
